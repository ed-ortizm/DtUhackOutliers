These are 2500 randomly (numpy random) selected objects from Kepler Quarter 16, Jan 12th, 2013 to April 8th, 2013. 

The data are long cadence lightcurves, each observation composed of 270, 6.02s exposures (about a half hour of exposure time per observation). I think we may have only used the first 100 observations though, about 50 hours of data.

Boyajianâ€™s star are included, the rest od the selection is random.
In theory, it should be fairly representative of the Kepler data as a whole. An incomplete breakdown: roughly 60% are G-type main sequence stars, ~8% are giants, ~2% M-type dwarfs, <0.2% O and B-type stars, ~2% eclipsing binaries.
