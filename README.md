# DtUhackOutliers

## Goals
Using a set of sparse light curves and a set of densely-sampled light curves, apply different outlier detection methods and compare their performance (possibly in a framework for voting on "weirdness"). 

After we generate a list of outliers, we hope to have astronomer "citizen scientists" examine the resulting outliers to see if they understand why these objects were found to be outliers. 

## Algorithms to test

1. Unsupervised random forest
2. Conditional entropy (RÃ©nyi entropy)
3. Persistent homology
4. Isolation tree 

## Data

We wanted to use both densely- and sparsely-sampled light curves. 

Proposed dataset: (Kepler lcvs (dense), Kepler (sparse), Gaia lcvs (sparse)
